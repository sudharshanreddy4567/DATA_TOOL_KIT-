#Python Libraries and Operating System Concepts

Welcome to the repository showcasing my learning journey in Python libraries and operating system concepts! This repository contains code examples, functions, and implementations I created while learning popular Python libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas, as well as fundamental concepts in Operating Systems.

Repository Structure

1. Python Libraries

Matplotlib

Learned how to create visualizations such as:

Line plots

Bar charts

Pie charts

Histograms

Demonstrated customization options like labels, titles, legends, and color styling.

Wrote functions to automate repetitive plotting tasks.

NumPy

Explored numerical computations using NumPy arrays.

Examples include:

Array creation (1D, 2D, and higher dimensions).

Matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, and transposition.

Use of built-in functions like np.linspace, np.arange, and np.random.

Optimized computations using broadcasting and vectorized operations.

Pandas

Worked with datasets using Pandas DataFrames and Series.

Key functionalities implemented:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, renaming columns, etc.).

Data analysis (grouping, aggregating, filtering).

File operations (reading/writing CSV, Excel files).

Practical examples include analyzing small datasets and creating summary reports.

2. Operating System Concepts

Covered foundational topics such as:

Processes and Threads: Demonstrated process creation and threading using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing and threading modules.

File Systems: Implemented file read/write operations and explored directory structures programmatically.

Synchronization: Explored concepts like mutex locks and semaphores using Python code.

Memory Management: Gained theoretical knowledge and implemented examples simulating paging and segmentation.

Features

Extensive Code Examples: Each topic includes multiple examples to reinforce learning.

Reusable Functions: Many functions are designed to be reused across different projects or scenarios.

Well-Commented Code: All examples are documented to explain the logic and concepts behind them.

How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sudharshanreddy4567/PYTHON-AND-OPPS-CONCEPTS.git

Navigate to the respective folders to explore examples and functions.

Run the Python files using:

python filename.py

Highlights

Hands-On Visualizations: Explore how data can be visualized effectively using Matplotlib.

Data Manipulation with Pandas: Learn how to transform and analyze data efficiently.

Foundational OS Knowledge: Understand how operating systems manage resources through practical Python examples.

Future Enhancements

Add more examples covering advanced topics in the above libraries.

Implement real-world projects to apply these concepts.

Extend the Operating Systems section to include inter-process communication (IPC) and scheduling algorithms.

Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more examples, optimizing the code, or reporting issues. Open a pull request, and Iâ€™d be happy to review it!
